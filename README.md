# Sandbox

TODO:
1. evaluate the hardware costs.
2. what kind of camera?
3. open source code.

details for projector:
In principle, yes. Ideally, projectors to be used for an AR Sandbox should have a native 4:3 aspect ratio, 
e.g., a native XGA resolution (1024x768), and a short throw distance (zoom factor of around 1.0) to match the Kinect camera's field of view. 
General-purpose projectors typically have longer throw distances (zoom factors larger than 1.0) and therefore need to be mounted higher above the sandbox,
 which often requires using a mirror to fold the projection light path, which in turn makes the overall system more complex and prone to loss of calibration. 
 In addition, modern general-purpose projectors typically have 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratios, which will lead to overprojection out of the sides of the sandbox.
